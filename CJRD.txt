** BDD is about discovery, collaboration and examples (and not testing)

What is Gherkin?
-> Gherkin is the language used to write Cucumber tests. It uses plain English to describe software behaviors.

What is a feature file in Cucumber?
-> A feature file contains the test scenarios written in Gherkin language.

What is a step definition in Cucumber?
-> A step definition is the actual code that executes the steps described in the feature file.


Feature: User Login and Logout

  Scenario: Successful Login with Valid Credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters valid credentials
    And the user clicks on the login button
    Then the user should be redirected to the homepage

    Then the user should be redirected to the login page
    And the user should see a logout confirmation message



Jenkins
--------
What is Jenkins?
-> Jenkins is an open-source automation server used to automate parts of software development, such as building, testing, and deploying.

What is a Jenkins pipeline?
-> A Jenkins pipeline is a suite of plugins that supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines.

How do you create a Jenkins job?

-> These methods are used to define the request specification, perform the request, and validate the response, respectively.

How do you validate the status code of a response in RestAssured?
-> You can validate the status code using then().statusCode(200).


DevOps
-------
What is DevOps?
-> DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle 
   and deliver high-quality software continuously.

What are some common DevOps tools?
-> Common DevOps tools include Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, and Git.

What is continuous integration (CI)?
-> Continuous integration is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.

What is continuous deployment (CD)?
-> Continuous deployment is the practice of automatically deploying every change that passes automated tests to production.
