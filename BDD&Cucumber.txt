# Behaviour - Driven Development 
---------------------------------

Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) is the software development process that 
Cucumber was built to support.

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a collaborative approach that 
bridges the gap between business and technical teams.

** BDD is about discovery, collaboration and examples (and not testing)


# Cucumber
-----------
Cucumber is a tool that supports Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD).

Cucumber reads executable specifications written in plain text and validates 
that the software does what those specifications say.

Specifications -> multiple examples/scenarios

Scenario: Breaker guesses a word
  Given the Maker has chosen a word
  When the Breaker makes a guess
  Then the Maker is asked to score

In order for Cucumber to understand the scenarios, they must follow some basic 
syntax rules, called Gherkin.

## Gherkin
----------
Gherkin is a set of grammar rules that makes plain text structured enough for Cucumber to understand. 
The scenario above is written in Gherkin.

Gherkin serves multiple purposes:
	* Unambiguous executable specification
	* Automated testing using Cucumber
	* Document how the system actually behaves

** Gherkin documents are stored in ".feature" text files and are typically versioned 
in source control alongside the software.

## Step definitions
--------------------
A step definition carries out the action that should be performed by the step.
